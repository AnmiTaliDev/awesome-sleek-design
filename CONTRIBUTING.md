## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the resource is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `**[List Name](link)** - Description (License if applicable)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.

## Quality Standards

To be on this list, resources should adhere to these quality standards:

### For Design Systems & Frameworks:
- Must demonstrate sleek, modern design principles
- Should be actively maintained (updated within the last year)
- Must have proper documentation
- Should be production-ready or widely adopted

### For Applications:
- Must showcase excellent UI/UX design
- Should follow modern design patterns (Material Design, HIG, Fluent, etc.)
- Must be functional and actively developed
- Should serve as good examples of sleek design

### For Tools & Resources:
- Must be genuinely useful for creating sleek designs
- Should be currently accessible and working
- Must provide clear value to designers/developers
- Should have good community adoption or official backing

## What qualifies as "Sleek Design"?

Resources should demonstrate:
- **Clean & Minimal**: Uncluttered interfaces with purposeful whitespace
- **Modern**: Contemporary design trends and technologies
- **Consistent**: Coherent design systems and patterns
- **Accessible**: Inclusive design principles
- **Functional**: Form follows function philosophy
- **Polished**: Attention to detail in typography, spacing, and interactions

## Open Source Preference

While we include some proprietary tools (especially HIG and established design systems), we have a strong preference for open source resources. When suggesting proprietary alternatives, please ensure they offer significant value that isn't available in open source options.

## Language

All resources should have English descriptions, even if the resource itself is in another language. This ensures accessibility for the global community.

## Removal

Resources may be removed if they:
- Become inactive or unmaintained
- No longer meet quality standards
- Develop security issues
- Violate the code of conduct
- Are superseded by better alternatives

Thank you for your suggestions!
